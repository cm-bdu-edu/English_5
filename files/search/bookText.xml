                   Workbook  in English  Grade  5 is  designed  to provide  students  with
            deep  comprehension  revisions.  It  aims  to  improve  students'  abilities  to

            deal with a variety of learning tasks and to fulfill students' requirements in
            the 21st century.


                   Pronunciation  —  it  assists  students  in  practicing  and  recognizing
            two-syllable words, as well as identifying word and sentence emphasis in

            English.

                   Vocabulary – it assists students in reviewing the main points of the
            lesson by selecting the odd one out and doing other lexis tasks with the

            aid of a picture.

                   Grammar  and  Writing  – it assists  students  in practicing  parts  of

            speech recognition by arranging words in sentences through exercises.

                   Reading -  students  have  to  do  different  reading  comprehension
            tasks  such  as  gap-filling,  matching,  reading  and  the  tasks  may  require

            shorter or longer written answers.

                   Listening -  students  have  to  listen  for  both  general  and  specific

            information. Questions are set out in the form of multiple-choice items and
            gap-filling.

                   Speaking – students improve having a good communicative ability

            by asking questions and responding accurately after watching pictures.

                   We hope that students will find this book to be a valuable resource

            for learning English and communicating confidently.
